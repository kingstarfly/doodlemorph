# Doodle Animator

Transform tldraw canvas into an AI-powered animation studio. Users can draw sketches, generate styled images using AI, and create animations from image sequences.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¨ Doodle to Image Generation

- Draw sketches on the canvas using tldraw's drawing tools
- Select your drawing and a contextual toolbar appears
- Choose from quick style presets (Cartoon, Pixel Art, 3D Render, Sticker) or write custom prompts
- AI generates a styled, high-quality image based on your sketch

### ðŸŽ¬ Image to Animation with Sora 2

- Generate a styled image of your character
- Select any image to bring it to life with OpenAI's Sora 2
- AI generates a smooth, cinematic video animation from a single image
- Download the final animation as MP4

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- A fal.ai API key (required - get one at [fal.ai/dashboard/keys](https://fal.ai/dashboard/keys))
- An OpenAI API key with Sora access (optional - for Sora 2 animations using your OpenAI credits)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai-canvas-character-creator
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Enter your API keys in the app:
   - **FAL API Key** (Required): Used for image generation and video processing
   - **OpenAI API Key** (Optional): If you have Sora API access, this uses your OpenAI credits instead of fal.ai billing

Alternatively, you can create a `.env.local` file with your keys (though the UI input is recommended):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_FAL_KEY=your-fal-api-key-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## How to Use

### Creating Styled Images

1. Use tldraw's drawing tools to sketch a character or object
2. Select your drawing (click or drag to select)
3. A contextual toolbar will appear at the bottom
4. Choose a quick style preset or type a custom prompt (max 50 characters)
5. Click "âœ¨ Generate Image"
6. Wait for the AI to generate your styled image
7. The image will appear on the canvas next to your drawing

### Creating Animations with Sora 2

1. Generate a styled image using the process above, or use any existing image on the canvas
2. Select a single image (click to select)
3. The animation toolbar will appear with Sora 2 info
4. Click "ðŸŽ¬ Create Animation with Sora 2"
5. Wait 1-2 minutes for Sora 2 to generate your cinematic video
6. Preview the animation in the toolbar
7. Click "ðŸ“¥ Download Animation" to save the MP4 file

**Note**: Sora 2 animates a single image and creates natural, cinematic motion. If you have an OpenAI API key with Sora access, it will use your OpenAI credits. Otherwise, fal.ai will handle the billing.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript
- **Canvas**: tldraw v3
- **AI**: fal.ai (flux-dev for image generation, Sora 2 for animations)

## API Models Used

- **Image Generation**: `fal-ai/flux/dev` - Generates high-quality styled images from sketches
- **Video Animation**: `fal-ai/kling-video/v1/standard/image-to-video` - Creates smooth animations from image sequences

## Development Notes

### Selection Detection

The app uses a smart selection detection system that shows different tools based on what's selected:

- **Drawings selected** (draw, geo, arrow shapes) â†’ Show Doodle to Image tool
- **2+ images selected** â†’ Show Animation tool
- **1 image selected** â†’ (Reserved for future "Make it Talk" feature)
- **Nothing/mixed selection** â†’ Hide toolbar

### Error Handling

All API calls include comprehensive error handling:

- API key validation before making requests
- User-friendly toast notifications for errors
- Console logging for debugging
- Timeout handling for long-running operations

## Troubleshooting

### "API Key Required" error

Make sure you've entered your fal.ai API key in either:

- The `.env.local` file as `NEXT_PUBLIC_FAL_KEY`
- The input field at the bottom of the app

### Image generation fails

- Check that your fal.ai API key is valid
- Ensure you have sufficient credits in your fal.ai account
- Try a simpler prompt if the generation times out

### Animation generation takes too long

- Video generation typically takes 30-60 seconds
- Make sure you have a stable internet connection
- If it times out, try with fewer images or simpler images

## Future Enhancements

- **Talking Characters**: Add text-to-speech and lip-sync animation
- **Asset Gallery**: History panel to browse previously generated assets
- **Advanced Prompts**: More detailed prompt templates and controls
- **Export Options**: Multiple video formats and resolutions
- **Collaborative Features**: Share and remix animations
